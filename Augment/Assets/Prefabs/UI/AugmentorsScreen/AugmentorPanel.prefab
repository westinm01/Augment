  augmentorName: Sali
  augmentorTitle: The Jumprope Prodigy
  augmentDescription: 'Hopper: This piece can jump over any ally piece.'
  augmentorLore: "\tThe eldest of five, Sali had always been accustomed to looking
    after others. Years ago,  when she was a teenager, she, along with her parents,
    lived in a home among the outskirts of a metropolitan area, with a well knit
    neighborhood community. Her father was a florist, and her mother a teacher. Though
    her responsibilities were plentiful, she always made time to hang out with her
    siblings and other kids. Outdoor activities were their favored passtime, even
    with the limited amount of playthings. Sali became to be viewed as the group\u2019s
    big sister, and no one could best her in a jump rope competition. \r\n\tThat
    happy reality shattered when a wave of sickness washed over the area, infecting
    Sali\u2019s parents with a crippling disease. They became bedridden, and Sali
    stepped up to handle their duties. Her workload increased, though she never thought
    of it as a burden. Others from the community pitched in as well, tending to her
    father\u2019s garden and donating what they can to both their treatment. Despite
    everyone\u2019s efforts, the two succumbed to their sickness. \r\n\tSali buried
    herself in work, not willing to rest for a moment, or else she feared she\u2019d
    have to face reality. Concerned that the sickness could be genetic, she gathered
    her siblings to partake in rigorous exercise and stricter diets in an attempt
    to strengthen their physical health. Every day  started with waking up before
    dawn, followed by grueling jogs and endless stretches. Junk food was thrown out
    of the house, replaced with vegetables and whole wheat bread. She got a tattoo:
    two black bands, forever having a reminder of the parents she lost. \r\nThis
    relentless determination went on for weeks, and Sali\u2019s training eventually
    culminated in her attaining an Augment. The same couldn\u2019t be said for her
    siblings, and they collectively voiced their discomfort from the training regiment.
    They pleaded with Sali, and she realized that while she prioritized their physical
    well being, she neglected their mental health. She yielded, reducing the severity
    of training and the diets, though compromised that they\u2019d still train at
    least once a week. \r\nHer siblings suggested that their time playing outdoors
    with other kids could double as exercise, and Sali could look into combining
    the two. She did, organizing community workout sessions to improve the health
    of others, and to take their minds off the sadness. \r\n\tIt was a success; not
    only were people exercising and being fit, they were enjoying it, too. Sali took
    up her jump rope again, this time incorporating it into her exercise. Her neighbors
    informed her that a certain scientist was scouting for people with Augments to
    participate in chess matches; the popularity of the games and the money that
    comes with it could be used to improve the community and acquire better treatment
    for future diseases. With her newfound goal in mind, Sali registers herself to
    partake in the game.\r\n"
